# Features
I think none of these require changes to type system? Automated struct getters/setters/constructors require auto-gen tooling though.

## Integers
- Basic operations like add, sub, comparisons, etc

## Booleans
- Boolean operations like and, or, etc
- If statements

## Structs
- Automatically generate getters, setters, field pointer projectors, constructors

## Pointers
- Getters and setters

## Async
- Fat async state machine model
- Requires the same getter/setter mechanisms for structs that we already have
